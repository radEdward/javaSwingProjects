# javaSwingProjects

Here I've put some Swing projects I put together.
* The first is a four function calculator in a simple GUI. I'd like, over time, to write more functions (trig, calculus solvers, linear algebra, etc.).
* The second is a small GUI that searches a SQL table for information typed in by the user.
* The third is a grid of buttons I made to function as a game board. This idea was later improved upon as a web app with Javascript (virtualtabletop.netlify.com).
