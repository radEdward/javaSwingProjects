# javaSwingProjects

Here I've put some Swing projects I put together.
> The first is a four function calculator in a simple GUI. I'd like, over time, to write more functions (trig, calculus solvers, linear algebra, etc.).
> The second is a grid of buttons I made in to a game board. This idea was later improved upon as a web app with Javascript (virtualtabletop.netlify.com)
> The third is a small GUI that searches a SQL table for information typed in by the user.
